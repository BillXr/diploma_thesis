My diploma thesis for University of West Attica degree in Data Analysis and Process Mining.

The thesis deals with the analysis and evaluation of business processes in Local Government Organizations using process mining techniques. 

Information systems data in the form of event logs are analyzed in order to extract and evaluate process models. 

In this way it is possible to identify weak points and improve processes. 

The diplomacy approach is applied to the Technical Excellence of five Dutch Municipalities using the ProM tool.
